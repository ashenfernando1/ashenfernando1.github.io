        <h1>Water jug demo</h1>

        <h2>Background and Instructions</h2>
        <p>Concepts: Pressure differences</p>
        <p>Holes at different points in a water jug show how water will drain to reach equilibirum pressure
        </p>
        <p>
            Fill with water, remove rubber stoppers as necessary to show how water reaches equilibrium pressure. If dropped while draining into a container,
            it will be demonstrated that water does not have sufficient pressure to keep pouring out during freefall.
        </p>
