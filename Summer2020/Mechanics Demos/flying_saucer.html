        <h1>Flying saucer</h1>

        <h2>Background and Instructions</h2>
        <p>Concepts: Spin precession, angular momentum</p>
        <p>The device looks like a rod with a ball-shaped base, and it sits in the saucer stand.
            When the air supply is turned on, the base will be spun, precessing on its axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sit the saucer without adjustment, attach the air supply to both hoses, and turn it on. Spinning and precession will start on its own, though 
            one is free to exaggerate effects by hand.
        </p>
