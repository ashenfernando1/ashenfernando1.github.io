        <h1>Magnetic demonstration system</h1>

        <h2>Background and Instructions</h2>
        <p>Concepts: Magnetic induction, Eddy currents, Diamagnetism, Paramagnetism</p>
        <p>Demonstrate eddy currents and how materials which exhibit different types of magnetism behave in a magnetic field</p>
        <p>Swing pendula between variable gap magnet to show effects of eddy currents. Hang glass rod between variable gap magnet to show how a diamagnetic
            material reacts to a magnetic field (it counter-aligns). Hang the aluminum tube to show how a paramagnetic
            material acts in a magnetic field (it aligns)</p>


        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 PASCO EM-8641 variable gap magnet</li>
            <li>1 ring stand with grooved rod for attaching metal</li>
            <li>3 metal pendula (solid, slotted, corrugated)</li>
            <li>1 ssmall glass rod tied to thread</li>
            <li>1 small aluminum rod tied to thread</li>
     
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from hanging the pendula, one coule also let the students hold them and feel for themselves the eddy current resistance as they pass it through the magnet</p>
